DESCRIPTION
---------------------

When we convert our project to zip folder, sometimes jar files do not appear in dist / lib folder.
Just in case we have added our .jar files under the Libraries folder. 
If the problem we say occurs, we would be very happy if you add the jars in this file to our code under the Libraries package.
We have reported this to you by e-mail.
We thank you.
